#2. Finite State Machine Generalization:
'''(a) Implement a program that automatically creates a set of ifthen clauses from the training table of a binary dataset of your choice. Implement different strategies to minimize the
#number of if-then clauses. Document your strategies, the number of resulting conditional clauses, and the accuracy achieved. '''



'''(b) Use the algorithms developed in (a) on different datasets. Again, observe how your choices make a difference. '''



'''(c) Finally, use the programs developed in (a) on a completely random dataset, generated artificially. Vary your strategies but also the number of input columns as well as the number
of instances. How many if-then clauses do you need? '''
