## Chapter 8 Question 1:

### (a)
MEC = (4 * 3) + min(4 * 3, 3) + min(4 * 3, 2) = 12 + 3 + 2 = 17 bits of capacity 

### (b)
MEC = 3 + min(6, 3) + 4 = 10 bits of capacity

### (c)
(a) has 17 bits of capacity, thus it can mermoize 17 rows of binary classification
(b) has 10 bits of capacity, thus it can memorize 10 rows of binary classification

### (d)
(a) extending to a case of 4 classes, 4 bits are needed to determine the class. 17 // 4 means that at most 4 rows can be memorized
(a) extending to a case of 4 classes, 4 bits are needed to determine the class. 10 // 4 means that at most 2 rows can be memorized
