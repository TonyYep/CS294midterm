'''1. Implement a deep convolutional neural network from scratch using a popular deep learning framework (e.g., TensorFlow or PyTorch). Train and evaluate the network on a 
standard image classification dataset, such as CIFAR-10 or MNIST. First, experiment blindly with various hyperparameters and architectures and observe the model’s
performance. Second, apply the measurements proposed in this book to reduce the hyperparameter search space and observe the model’s performance.'''
